# Duplicate-file-finder-with-Python-and-MySQL-2

This script is meant to be an upgrade of my first "Duplicate file finder with Python and MySQL" project published on Github. The first script took 9 days to complete the checking of aprox 100.000 files, whereas the second one took only 131 minutes to do the same thing. It was expected for the first one to take so much time, due to the high number of queries involved.
