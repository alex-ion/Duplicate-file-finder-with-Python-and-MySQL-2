# Duplicate-file-finder-with-Python-and-MySQL-2

This script checks if there is any duplicated file on a hard drive. The logic used to consider that 2 files are duplicated is:
- those files (from different folders) have the same name and same size
- those files have the same creation date and same size
- those files have the same modify date and same size
